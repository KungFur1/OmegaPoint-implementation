# OmegaPoint Specification
This is where the architecture of OmegaPoint system is defined. These two files were provided to us before implementing the system and act as guidelines for how to implement OmegaPoint:
* **`PSP lab2 OmegaPoint OpenAPI.json`** - is the endpoints specification file.
* **`PSP_Lab2_OmegaPoint.pdf`** - is the general specification document.

However, we made many significant changes, due to errors in specification. The changes made will be reflected in this `README.md` file.

## Changes

### {company_id} and {user_id}
Most endpoints contain company id and user id as endpoint parameters, however there is no reason to pass these parameters as the user will have to be authenticated anyways. You can't just authenticate a user who claims to be of id = 5. Besides there isn't a good way to know which company id to send. Are you going to query all companies and pick one from the list of all? (The omega point team said that each company will have its own unique front end and the company id will be embedded there) - fair, but still no reason to send company id, as it will have to be checked through authorization anyways. So, for these reasons â€“ we will remove company_id and user_id from most of the endpoints (the endpoints where they are used for authorization). Finally, after logging in, the user will receive JWT, which will contain encrypted user identification information. (Authenticated user`s company id and user id will be determined from the JWT. user_id as a parameter should only be used to interact with other users.)

### Some Endpoints Overlap
Some endpoints have overlapping structure. Therefore, they will be structured to start with the component name first.
